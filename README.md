# MemeMe-2.0
 Meme Generator iOS App is the third Udacity's iOS Nanodegree program project.
 
MemeMe2.0 is a Swift iOS application allows users to pick an image to use as the basis of a meme (either from their photos or from the device camera). Users can then edit TextFields at the top and bottom of the image. MemeMe also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid. It is developed as a part of Udacity Nanodegree Program.
.Version 2.0 saves generated memes and displays them to the user. Saved memes can be organized as a list or as a collection. Tabs allow the user to toggle between these views of the data.
